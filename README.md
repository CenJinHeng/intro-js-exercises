# Intro JavaScript Exercises

## Part 1 - FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a simple exercise in using common programming concepts, such as loops and conditions. [exercises/part1-fizzbuzz/]

## Part 2 - Basic Functions

We're going to be making use of functions all over the place in this course. This exercise is a warm up to defining functions and using function arguments. [exercises/part2-basic-functions/]

## Part 3 - Iterators

A common need when working with data in JavaScript (or any other language) is to loop or "iterate" over a collection of items. In these exercises, use `for` loops to create these functions. [exercises/part3-iterators/]

## Part 4 - Functions as Values

JavaScript allows you to construct what are called "higher-order functions". These are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as output. In this part, we'll explore how to work with functions in a more abstract way, which can be useful for data manipulation and transformation, or event handling later on.
